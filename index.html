        <td colspan="3" class="footer">Thank you for visiting! Hope you learned more about css selectors from here. In addition to standard selector nesting, you can also nest elements with classes: (element class {}) or (class element) or select all specificied elements that have a certain class with chaining (element.class)</td>
